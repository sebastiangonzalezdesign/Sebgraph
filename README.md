<!-- How to add a new project -->

-- Thumbnail --

1. Add the info for the thumbnail in data.jsx within the category
2. Add the new background color in abstracts/\_colors, then in \_tokens and finally add the new class in utilities/\_cards.scss

-- Project --

1. Duplicate an existing project and change the name. Example: pages/projects/Newproject.jsx.
2. Go to components/RouterSite.jsx and import the project previously created to redirect and display the information when click on the thumbnail.
3. Go back to the project file and adjust the content required.
